A box involving encrypted archives, source code analysis and more. </br>

Scan the target machine with nmap

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/nmap.png)

From the nmap result we can see there are two open ports. Port 22 SSH and port 80 HTTP. Go and visit the web site.

![website](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/website.png)

It's Apache default page. Let's try to scan for hidden directories

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.229.177/ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/gobuster.png)

There are two hidden directories `/etc` and `/admin`. Let's first visit the etc page.

![etc](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/etc.png)

There is folder `squid` 

![squid](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/squid.png)

Inside we find two files `passd` and `squid.conf`. Let's open them.

![passwd](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/passwd.png)

![conf](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/conf.png)

Now go and visit admin directory

![admin](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/admin.png)

Navigate through the page and see whether we are able to find anything.

![shoutbox](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/shoutbox.png)

Hmm... a chat between some users Josh, Adam and Alex. </br>

In addition there is an archive.tar which we can download.

![download](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/download.png)

Use the following command to extract it.

```
tar -xvf archive.tar 
```

![ls](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/ls.png)

Looking through the files I find out that the files are borg backup.

![readme](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/readme.png)

After some reasearch I find out that we can mount them using `borg`. 

```
sudo apt install borgbackup -y
```

Create a directory where you want to mount the files. I named my `backup` but before continue we need a password. Do you remember what we had found in one of the website direcories. Create a hash file and crack it with John the Ripper

```
john hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```

![john](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/john.png)

Now we can mount the files using the following commnad.

```
borg mount home/field/dev/final_archive/ backup/
```

![tree](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/tree.png)

Let's open these files.

![cat](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/cat.png)

Whoo! There are greetings for us and also we have found credentials. Try the with ssh.

```
ssh alex@10.10.229.177
```

![ssh](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/ssh.png)

Here it is the first flag. Now we need to escalate our privileges. Let's see whether alex has any right to execute commands as root.

```
sudo -l
```

![sudo-l](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/sudo-l.png)

Yes, it looks we can execute a script as root. Let's check whether we can add some commands in the script.

![ls-la](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/ls-la.png)

Good we are the owner of the script but we can't write in it. So let's change the permissions.

```
chmod +w etc/mp3backups/backup.sh
```

![changed](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/changed.png)

Now we are able to edit the script. 

```
echo "/bin/bash" > /etc/mp3backups/backup.sh
```

Now execute the script with sudo and we'll get a root shell.

![root](/assets/images/thm/cyborg/root.png)
