A ctf for beginners, can you root me? <br />

First thing that we have to do is to scan for open ports. We are going to use nmap for that purpose.

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/root-me/nmap.png)

From the nmap scan we can see how many ports are opened, what services are running on as well as their versions. <br />

Visiting the website doesn't give us much information.

So we have to find some hidden directories. I'm going to use gobuster

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.196.28/ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/root-me/gobuster.png)

From the gobuster scan we have found some directories. Go and visit `http://10.10.196.28/panel/`

![panel](/assets/images/thm/root-me/panel.png)

It seems we can upload files on the server that could allow us to get an access to the machine. Let's try to upload reverse shell. You can use the following script: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php`

NOTE! Don't forget to change your IP address and port in the script

![script](/assets/images/thm/root-me/script.png)

Now upload the script.

![php-error](/assets/images/thm/root-me/php-error.png)

Unfortunately we have received an error. I don't understand that language but probably it means something like that we are not allowed to upload php files. We can use google translate to see what exactly the error means.

![translate](/assets/images/thm/root-me/translate.png)

Exactly! The website filters the upload and we are not allowed to upload files with php extensions. First thing that we can try is to upload the file with other valid extensions, search in google for something like `valid php extensions` <br />

I tried with .phtml and here it what I received

![success](/assets/images/thm/root-me/success.png)

Again fast check on the result with the translator

![translate2](/assets/images/thm/root-me/translate2.png)

Yes, we were able to upload the file. Gobuster had found a directory `uploads` our script should be there. But first we have to start a listener.

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Once netcat is started visit `http://10.10.196.28/uploads/`

![uploads](/assets/images/thm/root-me/uploads.png)

Our script is there, open it.

![shell](/assets/images/thm/root-me/shell.png)

Here we go! We have a shell access now. Look around and find the first flag. You can use the find command for faster search `find / -name "user.txt" 2>/dev/null` <br />

The last thing that we have to do is to escalate our priviliges. Let's find out which files have SUID or SGID bits set.

```
find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null
```

![suid](/assets/images/thm/root-me/suid.png)

Looking for python SUID you can find the following page `https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/` gtfobins is perfect place when looking for binaries. <br />
Executing the following command will give us root access

```
/usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```

![root](/assets/images/thm/root-me/root.png)

Now you just need to find the root flag, you can use the same method as the user's flag earlier.
