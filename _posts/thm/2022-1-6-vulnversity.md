Here is another enjoyable room. As always let's scan the target machine with nmap.

```
nmap -sC -sV <machine-ip>
```

![nmap-scan](/assets/images/thm/vulnversity/nmap-scan.png)

From the nmap result we can see there are open ports 21, 22, 139, 445, 3128 and 3333. Go and visit the website on port 3333

![website](/assets/images/thm/vulnversity/website.png)

Now scan the website with gobuster

```
gobuster dir -u http://<machine-ip> -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

We have found a directory /internal

![internal](/assets/images/thm/vulnversity/internal.png)

After some tries we found out we can uploat files with .phtml extension. Upload php reverse shell code, set listener and go to http://10.10.176.156:3333/internal/uploads and open your script. Now we have shell access.

```
cat /etc/passwd
```

![passwd](/assets/images/thm/vulnversity/passwd.png)

Search for files with SUID permisson

```
find / -user root -perm -4000
```

![suid](/assets/images/thm/vulnversity/suid.png)

Keep in mind that you might need to press Enter additionally after youâ€™ve pasted and ran the commands.
