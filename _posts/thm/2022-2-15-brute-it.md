Learn how to brute, hash cracking and escalate privileges in this box! <br/>

We'll start our enumeration process with nmap.

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/nmap.png)

From the result we can see that there is open port 22 SSH and port 80 HTTP. We can also see the services version and what is the operation system they are running on. <br/>

Go and visit the website.

![website](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/website.png)

It's Apache default page. We can try to scan for hidden directories. I'm going to use gobuster for that purpose

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.137.187/ -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/gobuster.png)

We have found `/admin`, let's visit it.

![admin](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/admin.png)

It's a login page and we need to find a way to login. Let's try to see whether we'll be able to find something through the source code.

![source](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/source.png)

Yep, we have found a comment which tells us that the username for this login form is admin and probably john is also a user. Now try to login with admin and any password and catch the request with Burp Suite.

![burp-req](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/burp-req.png)

With this capture we have all the information we need to create a payload for hydra and brute force the login form.

```
hydra -l admin -P rockyou.txt 10.10.137.187 http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid"
```

![hydra](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/hydra.png)

Perfect, now we have the credentials let's login.

![login](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/login.png)

Here is the web flag and also there is id_rsa key. Copy the content and create a key on your machine. Don't forget to change the permissions.

```
chmod 600 id_rsa
```

Now we need to crack the key. There is a script from John the Ripper which can convert the key to hash and after that we will be able to crack it.

```
python3 /opt/john/run/ssh2john.py id_rsa > hash.txt
```

We have the hash, let's crack it

```
john hash.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```

![john](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/john.png)

Good now we can ssh to the target machine

```
ssh john@10.10.137.187 -i id_rsa
```

![ssh](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/ssh.png)

From there we can find next flag. The last thing we can do is to escalate our privileges. Let's see whether john has any permission to execute any commands as root.

```
sudo -l
```

![sudo-l](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/sudo-l.png)

Very well, we can execute `cat` command as root. We can look at `https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/cat/`.

![gtfobins](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/gtfobins.png)

So we are able to read any file. Actually we can read the root flag but we need to escalate our privileges. There is file in Linux OS which contains actual users password in encrypted format `/etc/shadow`. Let's read it.

![cat](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/cat.png)

Copy the hash in a file in our machine and crack it. This time I'm going to use hashcat.

```
hashcat -m 1800 root-hash.txt rockyou.txt 
```

![hashcat](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/hashcat.png)

Now we have the root password. Let's switch to root.

```
su root
```

![root](/assets/images/thm/brute-it/root.png)

Here we go, we were able to escalate our privileges to root.
