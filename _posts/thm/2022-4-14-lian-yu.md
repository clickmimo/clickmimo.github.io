Scan the target machine with nmap

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/nmap.png)

From the nmap result we can see there are open ports 21 ftp, 22 ssh, 80 http and 111 rpcbind

Let's scan the web server for any hidden directories.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.172.76/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/gobuster.png)

We have found `island` directory. Go and visit it.

![website](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/website.png)

It looks like there is something hidden, let's view the source code. You can either right click on the page and click `Inspect Element` or just press `Ctrl + U`

![source-code](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/source-code.png)

It look like some kind of username but let's use again gobuster to find any subdirectories.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.172.76/island -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

![gobuster2](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/gobuster2.png)

Here we go, view the source code again.

![source-code2](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/source-code2.png)

We can see one more hint, let's use gobuster one more time but let's try to find `ticket` extension.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.172.76/island/2100 -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -x ticket
```

![gobuster3](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/gobuster3.png)

Go and check this ticket.

![ticket](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/ticket.png)

Simply pasting this string in google it shows us that it is base58. We can use `https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/` to decode it.

![decode](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/decode.png)

With the found data we can try to login to FTP server.

```
ftp <IP>
```

![ftp](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/ftp.png)

There are some images and also a hidden file `other_user`. We can download the files using `get <file-name>`. Once you download the files you can open them.

![other-user](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/other-user.png)

Using `exiftool` we can read the metadata information of the image files. 

![exiftool](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/exiftool.png)

It looks that the PNG header is missing.

![magic-numbers](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/magic-numbers.png)

We can set the correct magic numbers `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A` with `hexedit` 

```
hexedit Leave_me_alone.png
```

Once the correct PNG header is set we can open the file.

![password](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/password.png)

One of the other files hides in it a secret. We can use `steghide` to find it with the new password we have found.

![steghide](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/steghide.png)

```
steghide extract -sf aa.jpg
```

```
unzip ss.zip
```

Now we know the username from the `other-user` hidden file and the password we have just found. Try to ssh.

![ssh](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/ssh.png)

Look around and you'll find the first flag. We need now to escalate our privileges. Let's check whether our user has any rights to run commands as root.

![sudo-l](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/sudo-l.png)

We are in luck. Visit `https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/pkexec/` to see how we can use it.

```
sudo pkexec /bin/sh
```
it's simple

![root](/assets/images/thm/lian-yu/root.png)

Here we go, we are root now.
