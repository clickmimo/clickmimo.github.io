Today we are going to face a well known vulnerability: ms17-010

Scan the target machine with nmap

```
nmap -sV --script vuln <ip-address>
```

From the result we can see that the machine is vulnerable to ms17-010

We are going to use metasploit.

```
search ms17-010
```

![search](/assets/images/thm/blue/search.png)

set the RHOSTS option and execute the exploit

![execute](/assets/images/thm/blue/execute.png)

Good. Now we are going to escalate privileges. Background the shell and search for shell_to_meterpreter.

Select the `post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter` module, set the SESSION and execute.
Press enter and view the sessions

![sessions](/assets/images/thm/blue/sessions.png)

Interact with session 2

```
session -i 2
```

List the process and select the process that has privileges.

![process](/assets/images/thm/blue/process.png)

```
migrate 652
```

Now dump all passwords

![hash-dump](/assets/images/thm/blue/hash-dump.png)

To find the first flag go to the root system
```
cd C:/
cat flag1.txt
```

Flag 2 is located where passwords are stored within Windows

![flag2](/assets/images/thm/blue/flag2.png)

We can also use the search command
