Are you able to use open source intelligence to solve this challenge?<br />

Okay we have an image WidnowsXP.jpg. Let's first open the image.

We can see the good old Windows XP background picture but what information we can receive from that. There is an tool called `exiftool` which allows us to read metadata informations from files such as JPG.

```
exiftool WindowsXP.jpg
```

We have to find whether the author has any social media account. After we had googled `OWoodflint` we found a twitter account with a profile picture of a cat.

That was enough to answer the first question. Now we have to find what city is this person in. He has a tweet in which he shows off that he has free wifi.

BSSID stands for basic service set identifier. It identifies access point and their clients. Also it is included in all wireless packets. <br /> 

I decided to look through the comments

suspicious, right? A base64 encoded text. You can use <https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/> to decode the text.

We have a clue. Let's visit this site and find out what is it about. <br />

You need to have an account. Register and search for `B4:5D:50:AA:86:41`

We have found where is he. <br />

The next thing is to find what is the SSID of the WAP he connected to. Just zoom the point we had found and you will find the SSID.

Now we need to find out his personal email address. Unfortunately twitter doesn't contain this information. I noticed from the google search earlier that there are other websites realted to him.<br /> 

Github account

We can see his email from github <br /> 

Now we need to find out where has he gone on holiday. One additional site which is related with Oliver is Wordpress website

Good. The last thing that we need to find is a password. It took me long time looking through the sites again and again until I finally decided to look into the wordpress source code.

Here we go.
